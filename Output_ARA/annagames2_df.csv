Players can proceed through the game as a street racer or a police cruiser; the storyline follows the rivalry between the two groups. As racers, players must flee from the police and can deliberately crash into police cruisers or other racers. In addition to crashing into racers, police cruisers can use various tools/weapons to thwart racers' progress: spike strips, electric/electromagnetic mines or shockwave devices, and a “shock ram” that hits cars with a burst of compressed air.

Players use a chainsaw, explosive rounds, and special attacks (e.g., performing cheerleading routines; mowing down enemies with a crop harvester) to kill zombies in melee-style combat. Some attacks (e.g., Sparkle Hunting Bonuses) require dispatching multiple zombies at once, and are highlighted by slow-motion effects and close-up camera angles. Cutscenes also depict over-the-top acts of violence: a zombie boss shooting himself in the head; characters getting sliced in half by chainsaws; Juliet punting a decapitated head in slow motion. Exaggerated blood splashes, dismemberment, and decapitation occur frequently. During the course of the game, players can dress Juliet in revealing outfits (e.g., Sexy Rider Suit, Sexy Seashell Bikini) that expose large amounts of cleavage and/or buttocks. Numerous jokes in the dialogue and on-screen text also reference sexual material (e.g., “Officer Stephanie sometimes used her nightstick to pleasure herself to yearbook photos,”“[She] had 'backdoor' sex with over three hundred sailors back in the day,”“Is it normal to have an erection as you die?”). A variety of sequences allude to drug use (e.g., “Old McDonald's been smoking too much weed,” and “[Influences:] Rick James, eight-foot piles of cocaine. . .”).

Cutscenes also depict instances of violence, such as characters getting struck down with swords in slow motion. Most female fighters are dressed in revealing outfits (large amounts of cleavage); their breasts sometimes jiggle while standing or fighting. Some bikini-style costumes (with thin strips of cloth) barely cover fighters' bodies, exposing large amounts of breasts/buttocks; one hologram-like figure appears to be nude—though her reflective skin obscures any discernible details (i.e., nipples or genitalia). In Photo mode, players can zoom in on fighters' cleavage or underwear as they pose for the camera.

Jak and Daxter: The Lost Frontier,"{'synopsis': ""This is an action adventure game in which players control an elf-like hero named Jak, who, along with his furry sidekick, Daxter, must save the world by collecting a mysterious energy called 'eco.' Players explore fantasy environments, interact with whimsical characters, and dispatch 'Dark Eco warriors' through a combination of melee and shooting attacks. Players can use futuristic laser weapons and oversized machine guns to blast at robots, 'eco eels,' and three-legged walkers that all disappear in a flash of purple light; these enemies also leave behind 'dark eco' (purple orbs) that can be picked up and used for weapon/power upgrades. Air missions (roughly 40% of gameplay) sometimes require players to attack enemies and floating stations: from a third-person perspective, players shoot lasers and launch rockets at airborne pirate ships that explode into a burst of light. The game's combat is supplemented by cutscenes that are mostly irreverent in tone; aside from a brief depiction of armpit-sniffing (e.g., a character sniffs, then says, 'No worse than usual'), the crude humor is mostly stated in dialogue: 'kanga-rabbits are gonna fly out of my fuzzy butt' and  'At least you didn't say the exit's through the rear.' The dialogue occasionally ventures into suggestive innuendo with comments like 'She's being entertained by the captain . . . if you know what I mean' and 'Ahh, not much for small talk are you'—a line delivered by a woman named Danger Sexy Pirate.

Comic panels include dialogue about belching (e.g., 'I only date guys who can burp the alphabet') and depictions of nose-picking, flatulence—a boy farts fire into the face of a smaller boy; the text reads, 'Rrrrip!,' and the boy-recipient emerges with less hair."", 'rating': 3}",1.333333333333333,NaN,79.32649359483051

James Cameron's Avatar: The Game,"{'synopsis': 'Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors—blue-skinned ""Na\'vi""—have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap.

Assassin's Creed II,"{'synopsis': 'Players ""relive"" the life of an assassin during the Italian Renaissance in this open-world action adventure game. The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets—politicians, Templar soldiers, conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords. When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the ""herky-jerky"" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly ""wet"" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cutscenes (the following two scenes do not involve players\' character): A businessman, crawling away from a Templar leader, gets pinned to the ground by a sword through his neck; a young nobleman is ambushed by rivals, begs for mercy, then gets stabbed multiple times in the chest amid screams of ""Muori! Mouri! Mouri!"" [Die! Die! Die!]. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense.  The game contains strong sexual overtones. During one ""seduction mini-game,"" players are able to press buttons to kiss a woman and remove her dress; with the woman\'s back facing the camera, the two characters lower to bed and blow out a candle. Some scenes take place inside brothels, though no nudity or sexual acts are depicted. The dialogue contains the following sexual references: ""So the whip or the paddle today?"" and ""Does your wife know about your page-boy fantasies, Captain?"" Character backstories, narrated through still-frame vignettes, explain how villains and historical figures achieved their notoriety; some biographies include references to adultery, sodomy, prostitution, and rape (e.g., ""Caterina was captured and sent to Rodrigo Borgia . . . who kept her imprisoned for a year and is rumored to have raped her alongside his son.""). One cutscene depicts a man and a woman wearing translucent, flesh-toned bodysuits as they flee from danger. The digitized lighting effects, the glow from their futuristic suits, obscure most of the details, though outlines of breasts and buttocks are partially discernable (i.e., not definitively nudity). Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity, both in English and Italian (e.g., ""f**k,""""sh*t,"" c*zzo,"" and ""m*rda""); the most explicit instance occurs when a man frantically describes a ""vision""—""I\'m at the opera . . . the soprano is so beautiful . . .

Players can also “execute” or incapacitate enemies at close range (e.g., punching soldiers in the face or snapping their necks). Some weapons cause injuries such as dismembered limbs or scattered body parts; a handful of sequences depict severely burned or mutilated corpses. During the course of the game, players have the ability to shoot unarmed civilians or open fire on angry mobs. Cutscenes also include intense instances of violence: bloodied characters getting interrogated and/or executed; soldiers getting shot in the head at point-blank range. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in the dialogue.', 'rating': 6}",2.666666666666667,NaN,60.2658080483306

Way of the Samurai,"{'synopsis': 'This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., ""attack,""""kill,"" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select ""Surprise me,"" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features  human  nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts. Some profanity (e.g., ""sh*t,""""b*tch,"" and ""a*s"") can be heard in the dialogue.', 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,66.46664934748655

Combat is highlighted by realistic gunfire, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes depict more intense acts of violence: a man shot in the head at close range; an unarmed character shot in the chest. In one sequence, a corpse is depicted with its legs chewed off. During the course of the game, a handful of enemies are depicted snorting cocaine or smoking marijuana; several missions involve destroying/infiltrating illegal drug operations (e.g., seizing packages of cocaine, destroying meth labs). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.', 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,90.0

Battles are frenetic and accompanied by screams of pain, gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations; body parts and bloodstains can be seen on the ground. Players can also employ stealth attacks, in which close-up camera angles depict more severe damage against enemies. Throughout the game, the protagonist provides irreverent commentary and jokes amidst the exaggerated acts of violence (e.g., “No guts no glory” when hanging from his entrails; “Oh that's gonna leave a mark” when dismembering an enemy; “That's because you have more comics than me” when repeatedly beating a character on the ground). The dialogue also contains mature humor, sexual material and innuendo (e.g., “Two less herpes cases to worry about,” “The pipe I was offered gives way more pleasure,” “So if I flip a coin, what are my chances of getting head?”). Other instances of mature humor include an extended toilet scene and the pumping up of an inflatable doll. During the course of the game, the protagonist is briefly shown reaching for and groping a woman's breasts; in another, he is depicted grabbing an inflatable doll's breast while in a hot tub.

Stuart Little 2,"{'synopsis': ""This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a US Army Ranger as he battles Nazi forces between 1946 and 1960. Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, fantasy weapons, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers and robotic characters. Players can also sneak up on enemies, stab them repeatedly, or slash their throats with a knife. Some weapons allow players to blow up enemies, resulting in chunks of flesh/blood strewn around game environments; large robots/mech suits sometimes crush enemies' heads or bodies. A handful of sequences depict bodies incinerated/mutilated by torture devices. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in sexual activity (e.g., a man thrusting against a woman on a table; a woman gyrating on top of a man in bed—camera angles largely obscure the sex act and no nudity is depicted.). The game includes a sequence in which two characters ingest a hallucinogenic drug from a liquid dropper; the screen becomes blurry and distorted. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,66.10738070057525

Players assume the role of Deadpool, a mercenary on a mission to hunt down and capture an evil millionaire. As players traverse enemy strongholds, they use an assortment of melee weapons (swords, sais, giant hammers) and firearms (pistols, machine guns, shotguns) to kill human soldiers and mutant enemies. Battles are frenetic and accompanied by screams of pain, gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations; body parts and bloodstains can be seen on the ground. Players can also employ stealth attacks, in which close-up camera angles depict more severe damage against enemies. Throughout the game, the protagonist provides irreverent commentary and jokes amidst the exaggerated acts of violence (e.g., “No guts no glory” when hanging from his entrails; “Oh that's gonna leave a mark” when dismembering an enemy; “That's because you have more comics than me” when repeatedly beating a character on the ground). The dialogue also contains mature humor, sexual material and innuendo (e.g., “Two less herpes cases to worry about,” “The pipe I was offered gives way more pleasure,” “So if I flip a coin, what are my chances of getting head?”). Other instances of mature humor include an extended toilet scene and the pumping up of an inflatable doll. During the course of the game, the protagonist is briefly shown reaching for and groping a woman's breasts; in another, he is depicted grabbing an inflatable doll's breast while in a hot tub. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” are heard in dialogue. "", 'rating': 6}",,,30.0

Players explore fantasy environments, interact with whimsical characters, and dispatch 'Dark Eco warriors' through a combination of melee and shooting attacks. Players can use futuristic laser weapons and oversized machine guns to blast at robots, 'eco eels,' and three-legged walkers that all disappear in a flash of purple light; these enemies also leave behind 'dark eco' (purple orbs) that can be picked up and used for weapon/power upgrades. Air missions (roughly 40% of gameplay) sometimes require players to attack enemies and floating stations: from a third-person perspective, players shoot lasers and launch rockets at airborne pirate ships that explode into a burst of light. The game's combat is supplemented by cutscenes that are mostly irreverent in tone; aside from a brief depiction of armpit-sniffing (e.g., a character sniffs, then says, 'No worse than usual'), the crude humor is mostly stated in dialogue: 'kanga-rabbits are gonna fly out of my fuzzy butt' and  'At least you didn't say the exit's through the rear.' The dialogue occasionally ventures into suggestive innuendo with comments like 'She's being entertained by the captain . . . if you know what I mean' and 'Ahh, not much for small talk are you'—a line delivered by a woman named Danger Sexy Pirate.

Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation.

Players use pistols, rail guns, shotguns, explosives, and Duke\'s bare hands to attack and kill the alien enemies. The majority of gameplay involves destroying these enemies in frenetic gun and laser battles in order to move on to the next section. Aliens are often decapitated or dismembered when hit, sending large splashes of blood across the ground, surrounding walls, and players\' screen. Some sequences depict more ""over-the-top"" instances of violence: aliens getting stabbed in the head or impaled; a human soldier bursting into bloody gibs after being tossed through propeller blades. In one sequence, players have the ability to shoot human characters that are trapped in pod-like alien webbing; bodies explode into pieces upon impact. During the course of the game, players enter a strip-club level and view several topless dancers and receive lap dances. A couple of missions within this level require players to recover sex toys and pictures of topless women. A few sequences strongly imply sexual acts: two women appear to perform fellatio on the central character (e.g., raising their heads from his lap)—though there is no actual depiction of the sex act; Duke moans and leans up against the wall of a bathroom stall (furnished with a hole)—it is implied that a sex act (not depicted) occurs. The game also contains several sexual references and innuendo in the dialogue (e.g., ""I have hungry—you have big egg ro\' for me, Duke,""""If you supply the dancing, I\'ll supply the pole,"" and ""I\'ll need something naughty to play with.""). Duke\'s comments range from jokes about colon cleansing to several one-liners about sex and female body parts. Bathroom humor includes the ability to urinate in toilets or urinals and/or pick up feces from toilets and throw it against walls. Players can use both steroid pills and beer as power-ups; when beer is consumed, the screen temporarily blurs.

Asura's Wrath,"{'synopsis': 'Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors—blue-skinned ""Na\'vi""—have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap.

NBA Jam,"{'synopsis': 'In this action role-playing game, players\' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies. Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., ""run-and-gun"") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with ""head shots""); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, ""Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,""""Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,"" and ""The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying."" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as "" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility"" and""if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so."" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have ""romantic encounters"" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out. Though an alien/human may gyrate her hips while on top (fleeting—one-to-two seconds), actual sexis never depicted—the cameracuts awaytospace furniture and ceilings.', 'rating': 6}",,,

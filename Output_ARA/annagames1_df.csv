Players roam Wild West environments and perform various missions for criminal figures and law enforcement: destroying bridges, helping individuals in distress, delivering packages of drugs (e.g., opium), capturing outlaws, and eliminating rival figures. Players use shotguns, pistols, and rifles to kill enemies in realistic gun battles. Players can engage in melee-style hand-to-hand combat and trigger slow-motion effects by shooting enemies at close-range or by targeted shooting (i.e., aiming for body parts). Blood often spurts out of characters when shot; head shots and knife attacks result in much larger sprays. In one sequence, a bloodied and mutilated corpse can be seen hanging from the rafters of a barn. Players have the ability to shoot pedestrians in the game; however, a 'Wanted Level'-penalty system discourages these acts by triggering a law enforcement response. The game contains a scene in which two characters have sex on a table; there is a brief instance of female nudity. One sequence depicts a man injecting himself with a syringe filled with cocaine.

The goal is to exact revenge upon conspirators who have framed and executed loved ones; the goal is to be accomplished through assassination. As players roam the crowded streets of Florence, Italy, they can creep through catacombs and corridors, undertake diverse side-missions, and tail-and-assassinate all manner of human targets—politicians, Templar soldiers, conspirators. Players can also brawl with family rivals or engage in sword fights with Templar soldiers, but in most cases, they use stealth techniques to complete the mission; for example, players can sneak up on enemies from behind and kill them with hidden daggers, poisoned daggers, spring-activated blades, and swords. When blades connect, blood shoots out in a fountain-like manner as targets groan or scream. These stealth-kills are sometimes depicted close-up and are somewhat graphic: the camera follows the ""herky-jerky"" thrusts of the blade; the player hears a distinctly ""wet"" flesh-impact sound. The most graphic depictions of violence occur during cinematic cutscenes (the following two scenes do not involve players\' character): A businessman, crawling away from a Templar leader, gets pinned to the ground by a sword through his neck; a young nobleman is ambushed by rivals, begs for mercy, then gets stabbed multiple times in the chest amid screams of ""Muori! Mouri! Mouri!"" [Die! Die! Die!]. The spurts and sprays of blood that accompany some of the stabbing attacks can be intense.  The game contains strong sexual overtones. During one ""seduction mini-game,"" players are able to press buttons to kiss a woman and remove her dress; with the woman\'s back facing the camera, the two characters lower to bed and blow out a candle.

The dialogue contains the following sexual references: ""So the whip or the paddle today?"" and ""Does your wife know about your page-boy fantasies, Captain?""

Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment.  In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence.

Bladed melee weapons and direct hits from rifles, shotguns, etc., cause decapitation or dismemberment; intense depictions include: piles of the Infected in a pool of blood along the roadside; intestines spilling out of abdominal wounds; zombie gibs shooting in all directions; charred innards; and skeletal bits and unclaimed torsos.

Heavy Rain,"{'synopsis': ""In this cinema-style action game, players control one of four main characters whose lives are altered by events surrounding the investigation of the Origami Killer, a serial killer who kidnaps children in public places. Gameplay consists of controlling a character in a fully interactive environment; choosing a variety of action-, dialogue-, and decision-paths based on on-screen prompts; and watching as cinematic cutscenes progress the somewhat dark (film noir-style) storyline.\r\n\r\nPlayers may encounter victims at various crime scenes: a woman (fully clothed) in a bathtub tainted with blood; a child under forensic examination (though the scene is largely narrative and clinical, with no depiction of victim's face or signs of trauma). More direct depictions of violence include the following: a woman squirming and screaming as she catches on fire; a man impaled in the chest with a power drill; a female attacked in her own home by masked male assailants (the scene is prolonged); and a man shot (shown in slow-motion) by police officers. Blood sometimes accompanies the acts of violence—whether triggered or viewed passively.\r\n\r\nThe most intense instance of violence occurs during a 'lizard trial' sequence in which players' character, Ethan, is forced to cut off a segment of his own finger to save his son's life: Several instruments (saw, scissors, knife, etc.) can be used to remove the finger; and though the camera pans away from the actual dismemberment—instead the blade, the blood, the scream—the scene's poring focus on Ethan's psychological tenor/terror (the dread deliberation before the cut) may be unnerving for some.\r\n\r\nThe game contains sexual content and nudity. Shower cutscenes may depict a male character's bare butt; if players control the female character, her breasts and buttocks are also briefly visible. A more prolonged instance of nudity occurs during a female character's investigation of a seedy club owner: After getting him alone in a room, the player-character is asked to strip; at gunpoint, she dances topless in front of the man. The game also contains a prompt-based love scene (kissing and rubbing) in which players match on-screen cues to angle characters' mouths, remove shirts and blouses, unhook bras, and lower to the floor; a woman briefly appears topless amidst the dark shadows and heavy breathing—actual sex is never depicted as the camera fades to black.\r\n\r\nThe camera does not fade on characters addicted to the fictional drug Triptocaine, referred to as 'dope' in the game: Players may see a character trembling next to open vials; lines of cut white powder on a table; and a man staggering from the drug's ill-effects, as the screen turns blurry. Consumers may also wish to know that the game contains strong profanity (e.g., 'f**k,' 'motherf**ker,' 'sh*t,' and 'a*shole'). Overall, the game's highly evolved motion-capture graphics (advanced renderings by 2010 standards) sharpen the sense of realism, increasing the impact of some aspects of pertinent content (the nudity, blood, violence, etc.)."", 'rating': 6}",2.333333333333333,NaN,64.04974910245966
Mass Effect 2,"{'synopsis': 'In this action role-playing game, players\' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies. Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., ""run-and-gun"") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with ""head shots""); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, ""Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,""""Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,"" and ""The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying."" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as "" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility"" and""if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so."" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have ""romantic encounters"" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out.

Dragon Age: Origins,"{'synopsis': 'This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., ""attack,""""kill,"" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select ""Surprise me,"" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features  human  nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts.

Players can also use chainsaws to hack at enemies, resulting in scattered chunks of flesh and large pools of blood. During the course of the game, female characters are sometimes dressed in outfits that reveal large amounts of cleavage or buttocks; characters are occasionally depicted nude, though their nipples and/or genitalia are obscured by “pasties” or blurry pixels. In one sequence, players can walk through an erotic club containing several phallic sex toys and sexual contraptions; in another mission, players drive around town while an escort and client engage in sexual activity—there is no depiction of sex, only moaning sounds and suggestive dialogue (e.g., “How deep's that going in?” and “That's some tongue you got there.”). Some game environments and dialogue contain drug paraphernalia or other references to drugs (e.g., marijuana leaves and water bongs on a table; a radio DJ telling a caller to try heroin).

The combat is frenetic, and enemies moan or scream when they are hit. Damage from weapons also results in large spurts of blood, dismemberment, and decapitation. When a human or creature is decapitated, an effect resembling a fountain of blood will shoot from the neck for a few seconds and stop. Some weapons cause enemies to split in half, the top being separated from the waist. During the course of the game, characters make jokes about streaking, body parts, rape, and mothers (e.g., '…more busted than my momma's girly parts').

As the noir–style storyline unfolds, players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to kill human adversaries (e.g., armed thugs, gang members, paramilitary units) in frenetic combat. Slow-motion effects (i.e., “bullet time”) can be utilized for improved targeting precision, and killing certain enemies triggers a zoomed-in “bullet cam” (close-ups of entry/exit wounds/headshots). Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation. During the course of the game, Max visits a strip club that depicts topless pole dancers. As he enters the club, fleeting sexual activity can be observed in the background: a partially nude prostitute sitting on top of a man; a character thrusting against a woman, whose body is partially obscured by two onlookers. The game sometimes references or portrays illegal substances (e.g., a “drug den” with bags of white powder scattered across a counter); in a couple of sequences, characters are depicted snorting cocaine. Alcoholism is a significant component of Max's character, and several cutscenes portray him drinking heavily and/or stumbling amid blurred screen effects. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*cksucker,”“c*nt,”“sp*c,” and “n*gga” can be heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,83.80034518294045

Blood often spurts out of injured characters and stains the ground and walls. Bodies also react to postmortem damage, flailing (i.e., rag-doll physics) and emitting blood long after death. Within the free-roaming context (i.e., not missions), players have the ability to kill island citizens (never children); however, a ""Heat Meter""-penalty system discourages these acts by attracting government agents and the local militia.

The game contains several missions involving drugs: Players must secure drug lines, find hidden drug cases to increase their ""Faction meter,"" and transport drugs via trucks and helicopters.

Missions primarily involve destroying rival gangs and their members by any means necessary: Players can attack and kill characters using pistols, chainsaws, baseball bats, knives, flamethrowers, and night sticks. Players can also roam \'off-mission\' and kill non-adversaries (e.g., pedestrians, shop-keepers, homeless people, etc.) at any time. Collateral damage includes spurts of blood when characters are shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned and extensive post-mortem violence (e.g., players can keep shooting at dead bodies, causing them to flail and emit more blood; players can earn \'respect points\' for taunting dead human corpses). One cutscene depicts a character holding a decapitated head over a railing. The game features cutscenes and missions that contain depictions of sexual behavior: One cutscene depicts a woman\'s head moving out of screen and into a gang member\'s lap – suggesting fellatio; Intercourse is implied as players drive around a prostitute who ""performs"" with a client in the back seat. Certain missions involve drugs – delivering, selling or arranging transactions –, while players can also purchase marijuana blunts, which can impair the player\'s vision through a \'screen-blur\' effect. Players can also hear strong profanity throughout the game (e.g. ""f*ck,""""sh*t,""""c*nt,"" etc.). ', 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,82.60824621085641
Saints Row IV,"{'synopsis': 'In this open-world action game, players assume the role of a criminal character that rises in the ranks to become President. Players traverse a virtual city prison, engage with fantasy alien creatures, and battle enemy gang members along the way. Players use realistic guns, alien weaponry (e.g., black hole gun, disintegrator), and super abilities (e.g., telekinesis and elemental attacks) to several creatures and humans. In a handful of missions, players are tasked with killing police officers and dispensing “mayhem” to complete objectives. Large blood-splatter effects occur during combat; some weapons cause characters to explode into pools of blood. Cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: characters executed at point-blank range; players shooting or driving over pedestrians. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless, with pasties over their breasts. A handful of sequences depict female pole dancers performing at a strip club. Players can also initiate brief romantic encounters between characters: one scene depicts a robot hovering in front of a male character (fellatio is implied)—there is no depiction of the sex act. A fictional drug (“LOA Dust”) is prominent in the game, and characters can sometimes be seen using the drug to boost powers—the screen distorts to show the effects.

Dragon Age: Origins,"{'synopsis': 'This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of mythical warriors through missions and battles in the ravaged lands of Ferelden. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person role-playing games where the user does not usually have direct control over combat moves. Instead, players select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, dragon, bear, etc.) and an action (e.g., ""attack,""""kill,"" and magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage by emitting splashes of red blood; pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. The most intense instances of violence occur when players have the option to kill non-combatant civilians: A prisoner can be stabbed to death in order to steal a key; a merchant who overcharges refugees can be slashed in the throat; and a boy possessed by an evil demon can be killed off-screen. During the course of the game, players are able to visit a brothel where a hostess asks what they are interested in. If players select ""Surprise me,"" they can sometimes wind up face-to-face with a woman, a man, a transsexual, or an animal; sexual activity is never depicted during these brothel encounters. Players can also initiate brief cutscene sequences in which couples (male and female or same sex couples) can be depicted kissing, embracing, and caressing one another as the screen fades to black. Though the game never features  human  nudity, one female demon character is briefly depicted with bare breasts.

Max Payne 3,"{'synopsis': ""In this third-person shooter, players assume the role of Max Payne, an NYPD detective-turned-bodyguard for a wealthy Brazilian family. As the noir–style storyline unfolds, players use machine guns, sniper rifles, shotguns, and explosives to kill human adversaries (e.g., armed thugs, gang members, paramilitary units) in frenetic combat. Slow-motion effects (i.e., “bullet time”) can be utilized for improved targeting precision, and killing certain enemies triggers a zoomed-in “bullet cam” (close-ups of entry/exit wounds/headshots). Frantic screaming and realistic gunfire occur throughout, and characters emit large blood-splatter effects when hit; some explosions (in gameplay and cutscenes) result in dismembered limbs or bloodstained surroundings. Non-adversaries—if unrelated to the storyline—can be killed without consequence, and dead bodies may incur additional damage. A variety of cutscenes (some interactive) include more intense acts of violence: a hostage getting shot at point-blank range; a man getting doused with gasoline and set on fire; an injured, bleeding enemy crying out during an interrogation. During the course of the game, Max visits a strip club that depicts topless pole dancers. As he enters the club, fleeting sexual activity can be observed in the background: a partially nude prostitute sitting on top of a man; a character thrusting against a woman, whose body is partially obscured by two onlookers. The game sometimes references or portrays illegal substances (e.g., a “drug den” with bags of white powder scattered across a counter); in a couple of sequences, characters are depicted snorting cocaine. Alcoholism is a significant component of Max's character, and several cutscenes portray him drinking heavily and/or stumbling amid blurred screen effects.

Some female characters are dressed in revealing outfits (e.g., skin-tight leather, lingerie, showgirl costumes), and players can enter a ""Peep Show"" or receive a ""Peeping Tom"" bonus. Some missions involve making, serving, and drinking alcoholic beverages (e.g., wine, vodka, and whiskey); if players drink too much alcohol, their movements may become erratic and they may vomit.

Mass Effect 2,"{'synopsis': 'In this action role-playing game, players\' objective is to defeat an alien enemy that is silently abducting entire human colonies. Players must assemble a team of henchmen, command a space ship, and travel to distant planets across a futuristic galaxy. At its core, the game involves a combination of conversation/interaction with characters, and ground-based (i.e., ""run-and-gun"") space battle: Players use assault rifles, submachine guns, shotguns, and pistols to kill humans, robots, and aliens in the frenetic third-person firefights. Some enemies emit large splashes of blood when shot (particularly with ""head shots""); several enemies lie stagnant in pools of blood—factors for the Mature rating. Henchmen are able to freeze and shatter enemies, engage in melee attacks, set robots on fire, and use telekinesis to disable aliens. A handful of cutscenes depict dramatic interrogations in which human characters are threatened, punched, kicked, and shot (in the leg) by alien creatures. The game contains themes of illicit drug use, addiction, and trafficking—often focal points to the branching storylines; for example, ""Morinth likes dancing while on a drug called Hallex,""""Narcotics flooded my veins when I attacked,"" and ""The asari injecting so many drugs into me was terrifying."" During the course of the game, players may enter a bar where alien pole dancing exists (choreography highlighted on big-screen monitors) or hear suggestive comments such as "" krogan  sexual deviants enjoy  salarian  flexibility"" and""if this is just about sex, maybe you should just  f**king  say so."" [Italics added] Players can also choose to have ""romantic encounters"" with the alien/human henchmen characters; this involves watching a guided cutscene in which two characters flirt, kiss, and/or embrace: clothed alien/human characters may prop a partner on top of a space console, clear away the clutter from a bed-slab, unzip a future-blouse, or just talk it out. Though an alien/human may gyrate her hips while on top (fleeting—one-to-two seconds), actual sexis never depicted—the cameracuts awaytospace furniture and ceilings.', 'rating': 6}",7.0,NaN,77.06909168148665

Yakuza 3,"{'synopsis': 'In this ""open-world"" action game, players assume the role of Kazuma, a manager of an orphanage in Okinawa, a man whose peaceful life gets interrupted by his criminal past. Players are drawn back to the Yakuza underworld—Japanese gangsters and shady dealings—as they follow storylines that take them through missions and Tokyo streets.   The game\'s main combat involves barehanded street fighting: Battles against thugs and gangsters are common, and necessary to progress through the game. Players punch, kick, grapple, and use weapons (bats, pipes, two-by-fours, etc.) to beat up human enemies. And after building up a secondary energy meter, players can execute more intense hits—slamming opponents\' heads into walls, head-butting them, throwing characters to the ground. Often, quick splashes of blood trail the hits. Cutscenes also depict blood, but more often, characters getting betrayed, shot, threatened, hit in the back with a sledgehammer, stabbed in the hand with a butter knife (the screaming in the last-mentioned scene is somewhat   unsettling).   During the course of the game, players are able to purchase and consume alcoholic beverages. The list of drinks on the scrolling menu screen is extensive; and players\' character gets intoxicated if he drinks too much (e.g., a glowing bottle icon appears on screen). The game is designed such that when drunk, players are more likely to get into fights: bystanders, gang members, street thugs—they get more agitated than usual, a little less tolerant of drunken displays (e.g., ""You reek of alcohol, pops"" and ""Your stench is making everyone else want to puke!""); metal chairs and two-by-fours settle most differences, though conciliation soon follows (e.g., ""Sh*t, I can\'t even beat up a drunk"" and ""I\'m sorry to have started a fight with you . . . Please, take this"" [3000 Yen]). One cinematic cutscene takes place in a nightclub, where bikini-clad women dance provocatively on poles—spreading their legs, bending over, gyrating; the camera tends to capture the low angles, and it pans and zooms-in liberally. The game also contains its share of strong profanity (""f**k,""""mother**ker,""""sh*t,"" and ""a*shole""); for example, ""Why don\'t I just kill the sorry f**k and become the next chairman?""', 'rating': 6}",1.666666666666667,NaN,78.75

Players manage a historical empire, including thousands of troops and sea vessels that can attack enemy countries. While much of the battle preparation and fighting takes place on land and sea maps, players can also direct their units into turn-based combat involving cannons, guns, and other explosives. Some of the more intense depictions of violence are contained within cutscene sequences: an army of British soldiers ambushed by French soldiers; the aftermath of soldiers massacred on the battlefield with small pools of blood surrounding their bodies; a man being executed at the chopping block as the camera fades to red. The game also allows players to build up their country\'s economy, which can include the construction and management of tobacco plantations and wineries.

Grand Theft Auto V,"{'synopsis': ""In this open-world action game, players assume the role of three criminals whose storylines intersect within the fictional city of Los Santos. Players can switch between each character to follow his storyline, completing missions which often include criminal activities (e.g., stealing cars, executing heists, assassinating targets). Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosives to kill various enemies (e.g., rival gang members); players also have the ability to shoot non-adversary civilians, though this may negatively affect players' progress as a penalty system triggers a broad police search. Blood-splatter effects occur frequently, and the game contains rare depictions of dismemberment.  In one sequence, players are directed to use various instruments and means (e.g., pipe wrench, tooth removal, electrocution) to extract information from a character; the sequence is intense and prolonged, and it involves some player interaction (i.e., responding to on-screen prompts). The game includes depictions of sexual material/activity: implied fellatio and masturbation; various sex acts that the player's character procures from a prostitute—while no nudity is depicted in these sequences, various sexual moaning sounds can be heard. Nudity is present, however, primarily in two settings: a topless lap dance in a strip club and a location that includes male cult members with exposed genitalia in a non-sexual context. Within the game, TV programs and radio ads contain instances of mature humor: myriad sex jokes; depictions of raw sewage and feces on a worker's body; a brief instance of necrophilia (no nudity is depicted). Some sequences within the larger game allow players to use narcotics (e.g., smoking from a bong, lighting a marijuana joint); cocaine use is also depicted. Players' character can, at various times, consume alcohol and drive while under the influence. The words “f**k,”“c*nt,” and “n**ger” can be heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,81.2

Players can use pistols, machine guns, flamethrowers, swords, Molotov cocktails, and grenades to kill enemies and occasionally civilians. Blood sometimes spurts out of injured characters, and certain weapons can cause decapitation or dismemberment. One still image depicts a character holding the bloody heart of a murder victim.

Most missions require players to find, stalk, and kill enemies with a variety of weapons (e.g., muskets, handguns, bayonets, tomahawks). Players can also engage in swordfights with armed soldiers, resulting in depictions of impaled characters and occasional slow-motion effects; large blood splashes appear when enemies are injured. Cinematic cutscenes depict additional blood splatter on characters' bodies and/or clothing, along with more intense acts of violence: an unarmed prisoner getting his throat slit; a man getting shot in the head at close range; a man getting bludgeoned in the head with a cleaver. The dialogue contains a variety of sexual material/innuendo: “King Louis filled the place with whores to keep his men from turning tail,”“[H]ere you are banging my sister behind my back,”“Don't flog the bishop again, lads,”“[T]hey spend 20 minutes simulating . . . sex and walk off with millions.” The game also contains the words “f**k” and  “sh*t.” (spoken in both English and French)."", 'rating': 6}",,,77.0

As players complete quests, they use swords and magic spells to kill enemy soldiers and fantastical creatures (e.g., specters, harpies, spider-like monsters) in melee-style combat; attacks are often accompanied by slashing sounds and screams of pain. Blood-splatter effects occur when enemies are hit, and damage sometimes results in dismemberment or decapitation—blood stains and body parts occasionally appear in the environment. Other cutscenes depict gore and more intense acts of violence: a close-up view of a severed head; a restrained woman\'s eyes getting gouged out (off-screen); a character being castrated (not depicted) before his throat is slit. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted topless; there is also a fleeting image of pubic hair as a woman dives into the water. Players can initiate brief cutscene sequences that depict varying degrees of sexual activity: a topless woman rocking on top of man; a man caressing a woman\'s back; a man pushing up against a woman\'s posterior—sexual moaning sounds can be heard, though the camera cuts away from explicit sexual acts. Some sequences depict a cocaine-like substance being cut into lines; another scene shows a man\'s back as he snorts the substance. Language such as ""f**k,""""sh*t,"" and ""c*nt"" can be heard in the dialogue.', 'rating': 6}",,,71.55321973359611

Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap.

The majority of gameplay involves destroying these enemies in frenetic gun and laser battles in order to move on to the next section. Aliens are often decapitated or dismembered when hit, sending large splashes of blood across the ground, surrounding walls, and players\' screen. Some sequences depict more ""over-the-top"" instances of violence: aliens getting stabbed in the head or impaled; a human soldier bursting into bloody gibs after being tossed through propeller blades. In one sequence, players have the ability to shoot human characters that are trapped in pod-like alien webbing; bodies explode into pieces upon impact. During the course of the game, players enter a strip-club level and view several topless dancers and receive lap dances. A couple of missions within this level require players to recover sex toys and pictures of topless women. A few sequences strongly imply sexual acts: two women appear to perform fellatio on the central character (e.g., raising their heads from his lap)—though there is no actual depiction of the sex act; Duke moans and leans up against the wall of a bathroom stall (furnished with a hole)—it is implied that a sex act (not depicted) occurs. The game also contains several sexual references and innuendo in the dialogue (e.g., ""I have hungry—you have big egg ro\' for me, Duke,""""If you supply the dancing, I\'ll supply the pole,"" and ""I\'ll need something naughty to play with.""). Duke\'s comments range from jokes about colon cleansing to several one-liners about sex and female body parts.

Players assume the role of Jack, a contestant and anti-hero who roams through industrial urban environments, kills as many other contestants as possible, and attempts to subvert the virtual survival game while playing by its rules. Rules do not prevent players from killing enemies in a number of over-the-top ways: they are sliced in half by chainsaws, impaled by lampposts, dragged in circles by a motorcycle, decapitated by golf clubs, and jettisoned into spiked walls, dartboards, and giant vats of oil. Players can grab enemies and hold them up against fan blades, jet engines, and other sharp contraptions. The result being splashes of bright red blood that contrasts sharply with the monochrome color scheme. Throughout the game, two TV announcers provide running commentary with the purpose of being irreverent and to embellish the exaggerated acts of violence (e.g., ""He should have seen the signs"" when a signpost impales a character). Commentators frequently make jokes about sex (e.g., ""Have you ever had sex with a conscious partner?"" and ""…he just has to convince him that unprotected an*l sex is okay!""), and some female characters wear outfits that barely cover their breasts. Commentators often use strong language (e.g., ""f*ck,"" ""motherf*cker,"" ""sh*t,"" etc.) and occasionally reference drugs (e.g., ""roofies"" date rape drug – slang term for Rohypnol).

James Cameron's Avatar: The Game,"{'synopsis': 'Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors—blue-skinned ""Na\'vi""—have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap. Officer Midori\'s waiting for you near the main gate"" and ""I was in Singapore with this fine ho*ker and . . . incredible . . . that\'s what she said."").

Duke Nukem Forever,"{'synopsis': 'This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Duke Nukem, an action hero who must save Earth from invading aliens. Players use pistols, rail guns, shotguns, explosives, and Duke\'s bare hands to attack and kill the alien enemies. The majority of gameplay involves destroying these enemies in frenetic gun and laser battles in order to move on to the next section. Aliens are often decapitated or dismembered when hit, sending large splashes of blood across the ground, surrounding walls, and players\' screen. Some sequences depict more ""over-the-top"" instances of violence: aliens getting stabbed in the head or impaled; a human soldier bursting into bloody gibs after being tossed through propeller blades. In one sequence, players have the ability to shoot human characters that are trapped in pod-like alien webbing; bodies explode into pieces upon impact. During the course of the game, players enter a strip-club level and view several topless dancers and receive lap dances. A couple of missions within this level require players to recover sex toys and pictures of topless women. A few sequences strongly imply sexual acts: two women appear to perform fellatio on the central character (e.g., raising their heads from his lap)—though there is no actual depiction of the sex act; Duke moans and leans up against the wall of a bathroom stall (furnished with a hole)—it is implied that a sex act (not depicted) occurs. The game also contains several sexual references and innuendo in the dialogue (e.g., ""I have hungry—you have big egg ro\' for me, Duke,""""If you supply the dancing, I\'ll supply the pole,"" and ""I\'ll need something naughty to play with.""). Duke\'s comments range from jokes about colon cleansing to several one-liners about sex and female body parts. Bathroom humor includes the ability to urinate in toilets or urinals and/or pick up feces from toilets and throw it against walls. Players can use both steroid pills and beer as power-ups; when beer is consumed, the screen temporarily blurs.

James Cameron's Avatar: The Game,"{'synopsis': 'Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors—blue-skinned ""Na\'vi""—have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap. Officer Midori\'s waiting for you near the main gate"" and ""I was in Singapore with this fine ho*ker and . . . incredible . . . that\'s what she said."").

The game transitions between animated cutscenes and puzzle stages (i.e., nightmares); in the nightmare world, players must help Vincent ascend crumbling towers by pushing, pulling, and climbing blocks to reach an exit. If players make the wrong move, they can be killed by spike traps and giant boss creatures (e.g., a demon bride, a chainsaw-wielding baby); death scenes are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of blood as Vincent is stabbed, crushed, shot, or bitten. During one cutscene, a character is stabbed in the stomach with a knife; a large pool of blood quickly forms under her body. In order to move faster in the puzzles stages, players can order Vincent alcoholic beverages (e.g., mixed cocktails, beer, sake, whiskey); after three drinks, he begins to stumble around when moving. These sequences are accompanied by voice-over narration: “It's said that chugging alcohol isn't good for you, but sometimes it's necessary” and “[T]ake a big swig of cognac!” Throughout the game, sex and sexuality are frequently referenced, sometimes while two characters are in bed together (e.g., “I finally became a man! Got rid of my V-card, BOOM,”“If the one you loved confessed to a sexual habit that you found absolutely unacceptable, what would you do?” and “After all you've done to my body . . . Night after night . . .”). One bedroom sequence pans across a man's legs, then to his curling toes; another scene briefly depicts a woman caressing her body while making suggestive comments (e.g., “I've got such a hunger for these feelings . . . I know you have some hungers as well, don't you?” ). The game also depicts the central character surrounded by topless female demons—though shadow effects obscure most details.

In single-player mode, players conduct missions on an unnamed Japanese island during World War II and then move into the modern day through jungles, deserts, and snowy terrain. The firefights contain realistic gunfire, loud explosions, cries of pain; large sprays of blood come out of injured characters during the fast-paced combat.

Metro: Last Light,"{'synopsis': ""This is a first-person shooter in which players battle enemies in a futuristic, post-apocalyptic environment. Players assume the role of a soldier who explores underground tunnels and toxic outdoor landscapes, while battling humans and mutant creatures. Players use pistols, shotguns, machine guns, sniper rifles, and explosive weapons to kill various enemies. Close-combat attacks involve the use of knives and/or bayonets to slash throats, or stab enemies in the head/chest. Large splashes of dark blood appear frequently during combat and cutscenes; blood also appears on walls and floors. Cutscenes sometimes depict characters getting executed (e.g., gunshots to the head). During the course of the game, players can enter a club environment in which some female characters are seen pole dancing; a topless woman is depicted dancing provocatively and close up during a lap-dance scene. In another sequence, the central character is depicted in bed with his girlfriend; the man briefly touches her breast, as the camera fades to black. Players' character can consume drugs and alcohol in a bar setting; when the character smokes from a hookah, the screen warps and turns blurry. A similar effect occurs when players' character drinks alcohol (e.g., screen blur and audio warp). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,
Fossil Fighters: Champions,"{'synopsis': 'This is a role-playing game in which players collect and train dinosaur-like creatures (i.e., Vivosaurs) for battle in a championship tournament. As players dig up fossils and progress through the storyline, they engage in turn-based combat against other Vivosaurs: a menu system is used to perform various attacks (e.g., bites, slashes, fire/ice/wind); damage is indicated by colorful light effects and a loss of hit points. During the course of the game, characters refer to Vivosaur “droppings” (e.g., Dropping Fossils), denoted by pink or blue coils, and make comical remarks (e.g., ""And you\'ll be Sir Phinnius Stinkbottom!” and “I\'m so excited I could puke!”).

Sniper Elite III,"{'synopsis': ""This is a third-person shooter in which players assume the role of a US Army sniper during World War II. From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, scoped rifles, trip mines, and grenades to kill enemy soldiers and complete mission objectives. Players employ stealth tactics to dispatch enemies from various ranges (e.g., crouching behind rubble to take a shot; sneaking up and stabbing enemies). Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, explosions, and large splashes of blood. Performing accurate shots sometimes triggers a “kill cam,” which follows the bullet in slow motion to its intended target. These sequences depict X-ray views of enemies' bones, ligaments, and organs shattering or bursting apart. The word “sh*t” can be heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,
DOOM,"{'synopsis': ""This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a marine on a mission to stop a demonic invasion on Mars. Players use pistols, shotguns, rocket launchers, and chainsaws to kill mutant enemies and demonic creatures. Large blood-splatter effects occur frequently as enemies get decapitated and/or dismembered during combat; a handful of sequences depict mutilated corpses with exposed organs/viscera strewn in the environment. Some attacks result in finishing sequences that depict intense acts of violence: players using a chainsaw to slice open an enemy's head; players ripping the heart out of a creature and shoving it in its mouth; players sticking a gun in a creature's mouth and pulling the trigger. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” are heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,

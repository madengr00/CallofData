A handful of attacks result in brief splashes or stains of red blood. Some female characters are depicted wearing outfits that barely cover their breasts and/or buttocks; low camera angles occasionally highlight cleavage or jiggling breasts. The game also contains suggestive dialogue: “I guess keeping your libido pent up all day has its advantages after all”; “Reiji only gets off on the company of women or the camaraderie of true friends”; “Did you get… boobier?” The word “sh*thead” appears in the dialogue.', 'rating': 5}",1.333333333333333,NaN,NaN

Leisure Suit Larry: Box Office Bust,"{'synopsis': 'This is an adventure game in which players follow the exploits of Larry Lovage in a quest to save his uncles\' movie studio from saboteurs. As Larry tries to identify the ""mole"" inside his uncle\'s vast studio lot, he pursues the affections of dozens of women along the way. The game contains frequent sexual references and innuendo, usually delivered with a tongue-and-cheek style that aims to be humorous: There are jokes about masturbation, penis size, bestiality, inflatable sheep, lesbians, oral sex, and pornography (e.g., ""I had to retire from porn, it became too much – I couldn\'t swallow it any more""); everyday objects and environmental features (e.g., statues, cacti, architecture) are sometimes stylized to resemble male genitalia or breasts; players can take photos of females kissing, moaning, and rubbing themselves or each other, then hearing comments about the snapshots (e.g., ""That one even gave the camera w*od""). Several females are depicted from low/close-up angles, have exaggerated breast-sizes, and wear clothing that reveals deep cleavage or portions of their buttocks. Although the game contains no explicit nudity or sexual scenes, there are occasional depictions of phallic sex toys and the sounds of women moaning in the background. Some of the over-the-top humor also contains references to getting ""stoned"" and being spiked with Rohypnol, a date rape drug (e.g., ""Was I roofied? Is my...bleeding?""). Players can hear frequent profanity (e.g., ""f*ck,""""sh*t,"" and ""p*ssy"") as well as some less conventional terms (e.g., ""c*ntsplices"" and ""c*nterbalance"") in the dialogue. During the course of the game, players can hit zombies with a shovel, engage in brief hand-to-hand combat against enemy goons, and shoot bandits with a pistol on a western movie set. When players enter a haunted mansion, they can see bloodstains and severed limbs and torsos on a table.', 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,30.0

Players use futuristic machine guns, shotguns, magnum revolvers, assault rifles, and chain guns to perform over-the-top kills that dismember and decapitate foes. Injured enemies emit large sprays of blood that stain the ground and surrounding walls. Specialty kills (i.e., Skillshots) represent the most intense instances of violence: enemies can be dismembered with explosives; impaled on spikes; and drilled into walls, resulting in body parts breaking into pieces. During the course of the game, players can consume alcohol and kill enemies in order to receive an Intoxicated Skillshot; the screen turns blurry during these sequences. The dialogue contains numerous jokes and comments that reference sexual acts, venereal diseases, and having sex with one's mother (e.g., 'Guess I know where the ol' gal got that limp.'). The names of some Skillshots are infused with sexual innuendo (e.g., Gag Reflex, Rear Entry, Drilldo, Mile High Club); one Skillshot (i.e., Fire in the Hole) allows players to shoot at enemies' exposed buttocks.

Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter effects, and characters pleading for their lives; dead bodies incur additional damage when shot. Non-adversaries can be injured/killed at will (this may negatively affect players' score), and some sequences allow players to kill police officers. Some sequences reference sexuality/prostitution (e.g., “This little bad boy can transform even the most ardent Buddhist monk into a sex-craving lunatic,”“Rumor has it she killed a John trying to rape her,”“The press published photographs of one of his orgies . . .”). Some party scenes feature women in skimpy lingerie (e.g., string bikinis, thin strips of cloth), and other missions portray women performing lap dances while men caress their chest and buttocks.

Players punch, kick, and use a variety of weapons (e.g., knives, swords, crowbars, machine guns, laser blasts) to drain opponents' health meters in melee-style combat. Matches are highlighted by impact sounds, splashes of blood, and colorful light effects as fighters are hurled across the screen or to the ground. As players engage in fantasy combat, they can trigger super attacks and transitional attacks that propel opponents from different levels of fighting arenas. Some up-close attacks depict characters getting smashed to the ground, slashed with swords, or propelled into the air by explosives; one partially obscured scene depicts a villain setting a superhero on fire. Additional acts of violence and/or blood include a character directing laser beams into a superhero's head (partially obscured); a man getting strangled; a character holding a blood-spotted knife over a villain's body. During the course of the game, some female characters are depicted in skintight outfits that expose moderate amounts of cleavage; in one fighting stage, background signs depict the silhouette of a woman and the words “beautiful showgirls” and “Live nude.” The words “sh*t” and “bastard” can be heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 5}",,,

Master Jin Jin's IQ Challenge,"{'synopsis': ""This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of Jackie Estacado, a mafia boss possessed by a supernatural force called the Darkness. Players use pistols, assault rifles, shotguns, swords, and axes to kill human enemies and demonic creatures; the frenetic battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, screams of pain, and large splashes of blood that stain the surrounding environment. Players can also use snake-like Demon Arms (attached to Jackie's body) to impale enemies, collect human hearts, and perform “execution” moves. These executions depict several “over-the-top” instances of violence: tearing enemies' limbs/heads from bodies; slicing characters in half; removing characters' spines. In some sequences, players have the ability to attack and kill bystanders or unarmed adversaries. During the course of the game, players can enter a brothel and walk through its halls. A few instances of sexual activity can be observed in the brothel: a woman performing fellatio on a man (e.g., camera depicts the woman's head moving up and down); a man pushing up against a woman's posterior as she is bent over—sexual moaning and slapping sounds can be heard, though nudity and close-up depictions of these sex acts are never shown. The dialogue occasionally references drugs (e.g., “[H]e was too busy snortin' coke off a hooker's a*s.”) and includes the words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“c*nt,” and “a*shole.”"", 'rating': 6}",,,

Large sprays of blood frequently occur and zombies frequently get dismembered and decapitated; for example, players are able to ride a motorcycle through mobs of zombies, sawing off multiple body parts. Cutscenes include the following depictions: zombies that rip chunks of flesh off humans; a man whose blood is churned out of him by an impaled spinning blade; and a man who drills a chainsaw into a priest\'s chest. Some female characters are dressed in revealing outfits (e.g., skin-tight leather, lingerie, showgirl costumes), and players can enter a ""Peep Show"" or receive a ""Peeping Tom"" bonus.

The gallery also contains images of female characters in provocative poses (e.g., arms covering bare breasts, characters bent over), or with partially exposed buttocks and breasts. The dialogue contains some sexual remarks: “[Y]ou c*ck-blocked me all those years ago!” “Ohhhh, you mean that pedophile?!” “Just stay away from me, you perv!” “I haven't played with those boobies in forever!” and “I'm in fetish paradise!” The words “sh*t,” “a*shole,” and “b*tch” appear in the dialogue."", 'rating': 5}",,,

Alone in the Dark: Inferno,"{'synopsis': ""This is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a Navy Seal engaged in covert, fictional missions against North Korean and Russian forces during the height of the Cold War. Players navigate through factories, docks, and enemy bunkers; investigate a secret missile program; and kill enemy soldiers while avoiding detection. Players use shotguns, assault rifles, machine guns, grenade launchers, and knives to kill enemy soldiers in traditional firefights and close-quarter combat. The most intense depictions of violence occur when players engage in 'kill moves.' These attacks can involve knife kills (stabbing/slashing of neck, head, chest, etc.), hand-to-hand kills (sleeper holds, snapping necks, throwing enemies off cliffs), and kicking kill moves (kicking out legs, head stomps, kicking in the face) from a close-up perspective. In addition, there are finishing moves that depict more prolonged instances of violence, such as slow knife-stabs and head-kicks to incapacitated/wounded soldiers. Most attacks result in large blood spurts that occur upon impact and occasionally stain the walls and ground. Strong profanity (e.g., 'motherf*cker,' 'c*cksucker,' 'sh*t,' and 'd*ck') can be heard throughout the game."", 'rating': 6}",,,

Players can also roll over animals and block-like humans who yelp as they are added to the pile; gunfire effects can be heard as katamaris approach police officers—no damage is depicted. A running storyline in the game concerns a man who is enamored/distracted by nearby “babes” (e.g., “Whoa!

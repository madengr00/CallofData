Catherine,"{'synopsis': ""This is a puzzle adventure game in which players assume the role of Vincent, a man with relationship issues that are manifested in his dreams. The game transitions between animated cutscenes and puzzle stages (i.e., nightmares); in the nightmare world, players must help Vincent ascend crumbling towers by pushing, pulling, and climbing blocks to reach an exit. If players make the wrong move, they can be killed by spike traps and giant boss creatures (e.g., a demon bride, a chainsaw-wielding baby); death scenes are accompanied by exaggerated splashes of blood as Vincent is stabbed, crushed, shot, or bitten. During one cutscene, a character is stabbed in the stomach with a knife; a large pool of blood quickly forms under her body. In order to move faster in the puzzles stages, players can order Vincent alcoholic beverages (e.g., mixed cocktails, beer, sake, whiskey); after three drinks, he begins to stumble around when moving. These sequences are accompanied by voice-over narration: “It's said that chugging alcohol isn't good for you, but sometimes it's necessary” and “[T]ake a big swig of cognac!” Throughout the game, sex and sexuality are frequently referenced, sometimes while two characters are in bed together (e.g., “I finally became a man! Got rid of my V-card, BOOM,”“If the one you loved confessed to a sexual habit that you found absolutely unacceptable, what would you do?” and “After all you've done to my body . . . Night after night . . .”). One bedroom sequence pans across a man's legs, then to his curling toes; another scene briefly depicts a woman caressing her body while making suggestive comments (e.g., “I've got such a hunger for these feelings . . . I know you have some hungers as well, don't you?” ). The game also depicts the central character surrounded by topless female demons—though shadow effects obscure most details.

During fight sequences, some female characters' breasts jiggle, while other characters make sexually suggestive remarks (e.g., 'Boing! Boing! Mmm . . . Your boobies are still the best!'). A 'Gallery Mode' includes still images of female character—in provocative poses—wearing outfits that expose a lot of cleavage; a couple of women's outfits suddenly disappear, revealing near-topless images.

Some sequences depict more intense acts of violence, such as a defenseless prisoner getting lit on fire; a man losing his arm from a sniper shot (with blood spurting from the wound); and a family dying (off-screen) in an explosion. In some instances, scattered packages of drugs appear in the environment (e.g., packets of narcotics that explode in white puffs when shot); in multiplayer mode, players can also unlock an emblem that resembles a cannabis leaf.

Players can also pick up golf clubs, bottles, cattle prods, and guitars to use as melee weapons. Other attacks include dirty diaper grenades and flatulence clouds; some attack moves cause nearby enemies to projectile vomit. Though depicted in a “cartoony” art style, battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. In one level, players can shoot physically handicapped adversaries (wearing arm/leg braces) and battle a robot-like boss comprised of wheelchair-bound individuals (i.e., Crippletron). As players progress, the dialogue frequently references sexual material (e.g., allusions to masturbation; oral sex; sexually transmitted diseases; prostitution). Other instances of mature humor include a dancing male character (his buttocks is fully exposed); a man requesting sex while dressed like a baby; signs or objects containing sexual innuendo (e.g., Angela\'s A*ses, “For a good time call toothless Annie”); an advertisement depicting fecal matter on a proctologist\'s finger. Some scenes reference cocaine use; a couple sequences portray vehicles with smoke billowing out the windows (marijuana use is implied); one cutscene depicts a college student smoking from a bong.

One prison scene depicts machines that continuously tickle, slap, and kick restrained characters. During the course of the game, a handful of female characters are dressed in outfits that expose moderate cleavage. One mini-game depicts a hippo dancing suggestively for nearby soldiers; another sequence requires players' character (a female fox) to distract enemy guards with her dance moves (“Shake it!” and “Move that thing!” can be heard in the background). An Old West-themed level depicts barrels/bottles labeled “hooch” and “XXX.” One boss character is portrayed with a lit cigar in his mouth."", 'rating': 4}",1.333333333333333,NaN,NaN

Deadpool,"{'synopsis': ""This is an action-adventure game based on characters from the Deadpool comic book franchise. Players assume the role of Deadpool, a mercenary on a mission to hunt down and capture an evil millionaire. As players traverse enemy strongholds, they use an assortment of melee weapons (swords, sais, giant hammers) and firearms (pistols, machine guns, shotguns) to kill human soldiers and mutant enemies. Battles are frenetic and accompanied by screams of pain, gunfire, and large blood-splatter effects. Some attacks result in dismemberment or decapitations; body parts and bloodstains can be seen on the ground. Players can also employ stealth attacks, in which close-up camera angles depict more severe damage against enemies. Throughout the game, the protagonist provides irreverent commentary and jokes amidst the exaggerated acts of violence (e.g., “No guts no glory” when hanging from his entrails; “Oh that's gonna leave a mark” when dismembering an enemy; “That's because you have more comics than me” when repeatedly beating a character on the ground). The dialogue also contains mature humor, sexual material and innuendo (e.g., “Two less herpes cases to worry about,” “The pipe I was offered gives way more pleasure,” “So if I flip a coin, what are my chances of getting head?”). Other instances of mature humor include an extended toilet scene and the pumping up of an inflatable doll. During the course of the game, the protagonist is briefly shown reaching for and groping a woman's breasts; in another, he is depicted grabbing an inflatable doll's breast while in a hot tub. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” are heard in dialogue. "", 'rating': 6}",2.666666666666667,NaN,40.0

Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, and rocket launchers to shoot and kill enemies; some sequences result in the death of unarmed civilians—though this can negatively affect players' progress. Realistic gunfire, explosions, cries of pain, and large splashes of blood accompany the frenetic firefights, and battles are sometimes highlighted by slow-motion effects. A handful of sequences depict close-range beatings of enemies (e.g., grabbing by the throat, pummeling). The main storyline involves drug trafficking, and players' direct involvement is sometimes required (e.g., selling drugs to earn money and experience points). As players set a marijuana field on fire, dialogue such as “Yeah, let's get out of here before they get the munchies” can be heard. Some storylines also contain sexual material and dialogue: a woman sitting on a man's lap as he reaches up her skirt—the camera cuts away to the couple caressing and kissing; brief instances of nudity, including a depiction of a topless female dancer; and dialogue such as “A four-way's gonna cost you a little more cash” and “For twenty I can take you to heaven, honey.” Language such as “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” can be heard in dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",5.666666666666667,NaN,NaN

Dragon Age: Origins - Awakening,"{'synopsis': ""This is a role-playing game (RPG) in which players control a group of warriors through missions and battles in ravaged, mythical lands. The combat system in the game is similar to other third-person RPGs in which users select a target (e.g., soldier, stone golem, snake beast) and an action (e.g., 'attack,' 'kill,' magic spells), then watch as the game executes the move. Players use swords, axes, knives, and magic to attack enemies that react to damage with splashes of blood; large pools of blood are occasionally depicted near dead bodies as well. Cutscenes may depict an imprisoned innocent kicked into a lava pit, a fire golem tearing a man in half, or an insect-like creature feasting on the entrails of the dead. Some characters engage in suggestive dialogue—mostly a dwarf character that makes several comments about sex, mistresses, and breasts. In one sequence, a demon character appears topless."", 'rating': 6}",3.0,NaN,50.0

As players navigate the island, they sometimes come upon corpses of murdered classmates. Players investigate the various crime scenes, looking for clues and interviewing fellow survivors. Finding the killer can trigger “punishment” cutscenes in which acts of violence are depicted: students thrown into a volcano, trampled by animals, stabbed by sword-wielding robots. A handful of still-frame cutscenes also depict characters impaled by spikes and hanging from ceilings. Blood is sometimes depicted on and around corpses. Cutscenes also depict female characters dressed in low-cut outfits and bikinis that expose large amounts of cleavage; these still images occassionally depict characters in provocative poses, with the camera focusing on pelvic areas. Some scenes contain sexual/suggestive dialogue (e.g., “That creep rubbed his ham-hands all over me and called it a body check! More like sexual harassment!” “My loins are still full of poison, and I'd appreciate it if you could suck it out…” and “some even tried to have children with Junko's dead body”).

The Chronicles of Riddick: Assault on Dark Athena,"{'synopsis': 'This is an action/stealth game in which players engage in first-person fighting and gunplay as they attempt to escape from a maximum-security interstellar prison. Players use firearms (assault rifles, shotguns, pistols), hand-to-hand weapons (fists, knives, clubs), and stealth moves (e.g., neck-snapping, strangulation, and throat-slashing) to kill security personnel, hostile prisoners, and humanoid mutants. Some kills can result in enemies getting stabbed in the eye or being dismembered, resulting in limbs that explode and litter the ground. Red blood often splatters on the environment when enemies are attacked or killed. Players can also encounter a character that masturbates in his prison cell. Although the character\'s back faces the player during the act, the sequence lasts for about 45 seconds and involves some moaning and shuddering. Dialogue within cutscenes contains some sexual references (e.g., rape and necrophilia) and strong use of profanity (e.g., ""f*ck,""""c*nt,"" and ""p*ssies"").', 'rating': 6}",4.666666666666666,NaN,80.0

Family Guy: Back to the Multiverse,"{'synopsis': 'This is an action game based on characters from the TV show Family Guy. Players assume the role of Brian and Stewie, two friends attempting to save their world from Stewie\'s nemesis. As players complete missions in alternate Family Guy universes, they use machine guns, shotguns, freeze rays, and other firearms to kill cartoon-like adversaries (e.g., fraternity brothers, pirates, alien chickens, Amish townsfolk) in frenetic combat. Players can also pick up golf clubs, bottles, cattle prods, and guitars to use as melee weapons. Other attacks include dirty diaper grenades and flatulence clouds; some attack moves cause nearby enemies to projectile vomit. Though depicted in a “cartoony” art style, battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, explosions, and exaggerated splashes of bright red blood. In one level, players can shoot physically handicapped adversaries (wearing arm/leg braces) and battle a robot-like boss comprised of wheelchair-bound individuals (i.e., Crippletron). As players progress, the dialogue frequently references sexual material (e.g., allusions to masturbation; oral sex; sexually transmitted diseases; prostitution). Other instances of mature humor include a dancing male character (his buttocks is fully exposed); a man requesting sex while dressed like a baby; signs or objects containing sexual innuendo (e.g., Angela\'s A*ses, “For a good time call toothless Annie”); an advertisement depicting fecal matter on a proctologist\'s finger. Some scenes reference cocaine use; a couple sequences portray vehicles with smoke billowing out the windows (marijuana use is implied); one cutscene depicts a college student smoking from a bong. The words “d*ck” and “p*ssy” appear in the dialogue, along with jokes referencing racial/ethnic stereotypes (e.g., “I feel like it\'s good to be some Asians, but not good to be most Asians,”""Oh, no, it wasn\'t me.  It was that other black guy!""“Who needs Mexicans when you\'ve got the Amish to build stuff?”).', 'rating': 6}",2.333333333333333,NaN,69.85624665050639

Hitman: Absolution,"{'synopsis': ""This is an action game in which players control Agent 47, a rogue assassin attempting to rescue a girl from various factions. From first- and third-person perspectives, players use machine guns, shotguns, sniper rifles, and explosives to complete mission objectives and kill human adversaries. Players can also employ stealth tactics (e.g., strangling or slicing characters' throats from behind) to eliminate adversaries at close range. Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter/pooling effects, and slow-motion attacks. Non-adversary characters can be injured or killed at will (e.g., throwing a bomb into a crowd of civilians), though this may negatively affect players' score; in one level, players discover the dead bodies of nun characters, with blood splatter on their clothing and in the hallways (the actual killings are not depicted). Other intense sequences include the use of a wood chipper to dispose of dead bodies (streams of bloody gibs are depicted), and an interrogation scene depicting a security guard beaten up by villains. The game includes suggestive/sexual material: One level takes place inside a strip club, which depicts women dancing on poles or performing lap dances in front of male clients; some strippers wear small pasties over their nipples. Other sexual material includes a female character briefly reaching for a man's groin, and a woman stripping down to lingerie in front of Agent 47 (e.g., “I love a hard man . . .”). During some missions, characters can be observed snorting cocaine off a table or smoking from a bong near marijuana plants. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,”“p*ssy,” and “c*cksucker” can be heard in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,67.5

Players can perform scripted moves after building enough meter; these Heat Actions depict characters breaking necks, slamming heads into walls, and shoving bats inside enemies' mouths. Violence is often accompanied by gunfire, impact sounds, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a bound man tortured with a sledgehammer; a character impaled by spikes. The game contains some sexual content: men groping women's breasts in a night club; a man guiding a woman's hand over his crotch. Players can also opt to visit parlors where they can flirt with women over the phone: close-up images of a bikini-clad woman are shown in the background. During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at a bar—a status icon indicates drunkenness. Another sequence allows players' character to engage in a game of darts after consuming alcohol, as the screen blurs and shakes during play.

At the same time, most sword hits result in blue or red glowing flashes and enemies that tumble in the air and disappear.

When zombies are knocked to the ground, players can sometimes stomp on their heads to complete kills. Large blood splatter stains the surrounding environment and players' weapon. Players can also dismember zombies, and various scenes depict bloody torsos, legs, or other mutilated body parts. As the game progresses, alcoholic beverages can be consumed to increase damage output, resulting in screen-blurring effects; in one cutscene, drunken characters are depicted stumbling around a party. Some sequences also reference drug use; one mission requires players to retrieve drugs for a character (e.g., “I haven't shot up since the day before yesterday and I'm getting the chills.”). The game also contains a handful of sexual references in the dialogue (e.g., “One rich bugger I investigated was clearly molesting his fourteen-year-old daughter.”); one scene depicts a bikini-clad woman tied to a bed and surrounded by video cameras. The words “f**k” and sh*t” can be heard in dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,49.0

Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects (blood also stains the ground). Some games allow non-adversary characters/prisoners to be injured or killed; cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: enemy soldiers executed at point-blank range; a restrained character beaten during an interrogation.

In some sequences, players can enter a cardboard box (""Love Pack"") to engage in sexual acts with another character—there is no depiction of the sexual acts, though moaning sounds occur. Players also have the ability to unlock a “Snake Beater” award after repeatedly zooming in on a picture of a woman in lingerie.

Supreme Commander 2,"{'synopsis': ""This is a real-time strategy game in which players assume the role of a commander of one of three intergalactic factions. From an overhead perspective, players control an armored command unit on a vast battlefield. This main base is essentially a giant piloted robot, and it is the hub from which players use their resource management skills and strategic planning to survive the futuristic battles. Players can launch missiles, dispatch soldiers, position robots and tanks, and release laser fire to defeat enemy units. In some sequences, robots and structures explode in a flurry of small laser blasts. Occasionally, soldiers within the robotic armor can be seen reacting with pain when attacked. Branching storylines depict dramatic scenes: space battles in which ships and stations explode, buildings laid in waste, factories set ablaze, soldiers mourning comrades at lonely tombstones. Though laser fire gets frenetic, and the themes are sometimes heavy, players are essentially building, salvaging, guarding, and dispatching—actions dictated by commands, a viewpoint that is somewhat detached (bird's-eye view of the grid-like landscape)."", 'rating': 4}",,,

Players undertake missions/quests that increase characters' skills, eliminate an assortment of mutant creatures, and drive and collide with advanced alien vehicles. Players kill hundreds of enemies (e.g., human bandits and mercenary soldiers) over the course of the game by using a wide variety of guns (shotguns, sniper rifles), explosives, and special ammo types (fire, acid and electricity, etc.). The combat is frenetic, and enemies moan or scream when they are hit. Damage from weapons also results in large spurts of blood, dismemberment, and decapitation. When a human or creature is decapitated, an effect resembling a fountain of blood will shoot from the neck for a few seconds and stop. Some weapons cause enemies to split in half, the top being separated from the waist. During the course of the game, characters make jokes about streaking, body parts, rape, and mothers (e.g., '…more busted than my momma's girly parts').

Players can engage in surgery, diagnostics, orthopedics, endoscopy, forensics, and emergency response. Patients on operating tables resemble 3D models, somewhat mannequin-like and polygonal—intended as a clinical depiction. Players can reassemble broken bones; use scalpels, sutures, and lasers to cut into patients; run tests and physical exams. Surgery requires players to suction away blood, overlay layers of tissue, repair damaged blood vessels; blood-stained clothing is also depicted.   The still-frame cutscenes narrate doctors\' missions and detail how hospital patients received their injuries. These highly-stylized images (graphic-novel art-style) generally involve a camera panning across still-frames and still-motion characters. One sequence shows the aftermath of a mall massacre, where victims can be heard screaming, their bodies lying near small pools of blood; another scene shows a man, infected with a virus, with blood dripping from his eyes and nose—the camera pans out behind the man as quick sprays of blood appear; and a women strapped with explosives threatens to kill people in one dramatic scene.   During the diagnostics portion of the game, players must diagnose patients by using the stethoscope and performing visual inspections. Female patients are asked to explain their symptoms, then lift up their shirts for closer inspection. The scene contains no nudity, but a saxophone can be heard playing in the background as a male doctor makes the following remarks: ""Can she really be that thin?,""""dayum!,"" and—after doctor\'s heart rate increases—""It\'s only natural . . . I\'m a straight male."" During the course of the game, characters sometimes use language such as ""bullsh*t,""""a*shole,"" and ""b*tch.""

As players explore various districts and follow the storyline, they engage in missions that often involve fistfights with thugs or rival gang members; characters can also use weapons such as bats during frenetic combat sequences. Players can perform scripted moves after building enough meter; these Heat Actions depict characters breaking necks, slamming heads into walls, and shoving bats inside enemies' mouths. Violence is often accompanied by gunfire, impact sounds, screams of pain, and blood-splatter effects. Cutscenes depict intense acts of violence: characters shot in the head; a bound man tortured with a sledgehammer; a character impaled by spikes. The game contains some sexual content: men groping women's breasts in a night club; a man guiding a woman's hand over his crotch. Players can also opt to visit parlors where they can flirt with women over the phone: close-up images of a bikini-clad woman are shown in the background. During the course of the game, players can order and drink whiskey at a bar—a status icon indicates drunkenness. Another sequence allows players' character to engage in a game of darts after consuming alcohol, as the screen blurs and shakes during play. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,

The Secret World,"{'synopsis': ""This is a massively multiplayer online (MMO) role-playing game in which players assume the role of agents who battle evil forces around the globe. As players interact with numerous characters in real-world locales, they engage in frenetic melee-style combat with zombies, demons, wolves, and humans. Swords, guns, and magic attacks can be used to kill nearby adversaries; realistic gunfire and explosions can be heard during battle. Damage sometimes results in large blood-splatter effects, and some environments depict larger blood stains/smears on the ground. In one “meat store” scene, corpses can be seen hanging from meat hooks or lying on the ground. During the course of the game, one female succubus enemy is depicted topless; her breasts bounce up and down during combat. In one extended cutscene, a woman seductively caresses players' character before moving her head off-screen—oral sex is implied, though never shown. Some scenes reference drug use (e.g., “[Rome wasn't built] by deadbeat procrastinators lazying around on their asses smoking weed either,” “Have you ever seen a psychiatrist or taken psychedelic drugs?”); in one sequence, a man is depicted smoking a marijuana joint. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.\r\n\r\nOnline Interactions Not Rated by the ESRB"", 'rating': 6}",,,

Players use torches, bows, spears, and swords to attack enemy creatures in fast-paced ""melee""-style combat. Though the art-style is somewhat cartoonlike and stylized, the sword-fighting action on the battlefield can be frenetic: loud metallic sword clashing, battle cries and shrieks of pain, specialized ""lunging"" sword moves, and hordes of fantastical enemies that must be dispatched at one time (e.g., orcs, goblins, trolls, giant spiders, and wolves). At the same time, most sword hits result in blue or red glowing flashes and enemies that tumble in the air and disappear. The game also features one-on-one combat with a black-cloaked Ring Wraith that shrieks loudly, and a few environments that are darker, more foreboding than the majority of the battles (which tend to be lighter, more colorful).', 'rating': 5}",,,

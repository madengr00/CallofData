Players travel around the world, navigate through missions that increase characters' skill, and eliminate an assortment of enemies and terrorists. Players use shotguns, assault rifles, machine guns, grenades, and knives to kill enemies. Stealth attacks allow players to sneak up on and stab unsuspecting enemies. The most intense depictions of violence occur during interactive cutscenes where players have the option to 'spare/wait' or 'execute/goodbye' villains. Players can shoot surrendered enemies at close range with bullets to the stomach, kneecap, and forehead. Most injuries and deaths result in blood splatter that occasionally pools on the floor. During the course of the game, players can come across exotic dancers dressed in skimpy clothing. In one scene, the central character has (implied) sex with a female villain: The villain is shown in underwear and climbs on top of the central character and mounts him; sexual activity is never depicted as the scene fades to black. One character in the game is depicted snorting cocaine from his hand; the central character comments that the person is 'f*cking high.'"", 'rating': 6}",1.333333333333333,NaN,NaN

Violent encounters are accompanied by realistic gunfire/explosions, large blood-splatter effects, and characters pleading for their lives; dead bodies incur additional damage when shot. Non-adversaries can be injured/killed at will (this may negatively affect players' score), and some sequences allow players to kill police officers. Some sequences reference sexuality/prostitution (e.g., “This little bad boy can transform even the most ardent Buddhist monk into a sex-craving lunatic,”“Rumor has it she killed a John trying to rape her,”“The press published photographs of one of his orgies . . .”). Some party scenes feature women in skimpy lingerie (e.g., string bikinis, thin strips of cloth), and other missions portray women performing lap dances while men caress their chest and buttocks.

From a 3/4–overhead perspective, players use swords, axes, and magic spells to engage monsters and human-like characters in turn-based combat (e.g., selecting attacks/weapons from a menu screen). Battles are accompanied by light effects, slashing sounds, and cries of pain; enemies disappear when defeated. One special attack depicts a bullet striking an enemy's head, which is accompanied by slow-motion and X-ray effects. A few cutscenes depict brief stylized blood effects (e.g., an armored knight emitting blue droplets after getting impaled; the silhouette of blood splatter after a character is struck). During the course of the game, some of the dialogue includes suggestive comments (e.g., “You've earned the right to be called a pervert, by sneaking around and peeping on us,” “I just love it when men do things that constitute sexual harassment,” and “You're so flat, they use your chest to measure if a shelf is straight!”). The game also contains a brief drug reference (e.g., “If you inhale my dust, you'll get really happy. It might even make you feel like you can fly . . . Just say no, kids! Bad! Bad drugs!”). The words “sh*t,” “a*s,” and “b*tch” can be heard in dialogue."", 'rating': 5}",1.333333333333333,NaN,NaN

Players can also command several ""tag-along"" gremlin-like minions to attack enemies (e.g., carnivorous pandas, giant spiders, elves, Roman soldiers, etc.), break objects, and open pathways that allow the Overlord to progress. During one sequence, players use a lightning-strike attack to either kill villagers or subdue them. Players\' Minions can also be led to consume liquids (a strong implication of alcohol), causing them to belch, urinate, or vomit on the ground. There is also a sequence in which players need to ""fool the drunken villager."" The game contains some suggestive material: There are depictions of fairy creatures with flowers that barely cover their exaggerated-sized breasts; reward cut-scenes strongly imply that the central character has sex with his mistress (e.g., the camera shakes; pleasurable moaning sounds); and dialogue contains suggestive content and innuendo (e.g.,""They said I slept with the Senators daughter… I never! … I slept with his wife!"" and ""Prepare yourself for a very mmmmm spiritual experience"").', 'rating': 5}",1.666666666666667,NaN,NaN

Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward,"{'synopsis': ""This is a puzzle-adventure game in which players follow characters attempting to escape from a mysterious warehouse. As players solve environmental puzzles and interact with fellow captives, their decisions trigger various cutscenes, some of which include brief acts of violence: players' character getting strangled in first person (the screen blurs and fades to black); a woman attempting to stab herself with a scalpel. As the game progresses, various sequences depict bloodstained rooms and/or blood-splattered bodies, including characters lying in large pools of blood in the aftermath of a mass suicide (implied through on-screen text). Some of the dialogue contains sexual material/innuendo (e.g., “Not like I'm hoping to get my face sandwiched between a girl's bare thighs,” “Just leave me and Luna out of your sick fantasies, you creep,” “[A]re you trying to get me to take my clothes off?” and “Can you, like . . . kind of slide it down into your cleavage . . .”). Pharmaceutical drugs are a central part of the plotline, and references to other illicit substances occur during various scenes: “You must be really desperate to get high,” “You must've done a lot of drugs to look like that at twenty-two,” “Or was it just a hallucination, brought on by stress or maybe some strange drug they'd dosed me with while I was out?” The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” also appear in dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",4.333333333333334,NaN,40.0

Bloodstains are sometimes depicted on walls, the ground, and on the sides of Tartarus. Female creatures (female Personas) occasionally are depicted topless or with revealing costumes; male creatures have phallic-shaped heads and torsos.

Assuming the role of the First Horseman of the Apocalypse (""War""), players use giant blades and guns to kill angels, demons, skeletons, zombie-like creatures, and undead horses. The melee-style combat can be intense and frenetic: Players hack-and-slash enemies at a constant rate; screams, rending flesh, and swords clashing/slashing can be heard; and ""quick-kill"" animations depict deaths close-up. This last-mentioned aspect of combat allows players to dismember creatures in dramatic fashion; for example, players can cut off enemies\' legs and arms, chop off their heads, snap their necks, or pull off their wings. Dark red blood gushes out of creatures\' hearts, necks, and limbs in a fountain-like manner. In one sequence, blood flows out of a statue and forms a river in the grooves of a stone puzzle on the ground.

From a third-person perspective, players explore environments (e.g., desert communities, dystopian slums, ice cities), perform various quests, and fight enemy soldiers, thugs, and civilian characters. Characters use staffs and electric attacks to injure and kill human enemies. Combat is highlighted by cries of pain, impact sounds, and splashes of blood. The game includes some sexual material: prostitutes appearing in some locations while soliciting customers; cutscenes depicting characters (fully clothed) that straddle or caress each other in bed. A handful of missions involve procuring narcotics for others; the dialogue also references drugs (e.g., “I'd love to get my hands of some of that focus drug. I know it's not meant for us, but it gives me a nice buzz”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,

Corpses are frequently depicted with bloodstains and sometimes mangled fingers, dangling entrails, or exposed brains. The game also contains sexual material, in still images and text: two female characters moaning off screen while discussing each other's breasts (e.g., “Hmm…you've got big breasts, don't you Hana?”); a dream sequence in which a character grabs another's crotch (e.g., “Was I really dreaming about someone rubbing my crotch?”); prolonged innuendo about an ice cream cone (e.g., “I saw her tongue flick seductively for a moment before her tiny mouth swallowed the whole thing.”); references to sexual fetishes and masturbation. Still images also depict partially exposed breasts and buttocks. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,

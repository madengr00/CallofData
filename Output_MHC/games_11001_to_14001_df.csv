Atelier Totori: The Adventurer of Arland,"{'synopsis': ""This is a role-playing game in which players assume the role of Totori, a young alchemist on a quest to find her missing mother. As players explore landscapes and collect treasure, they use staffs, spears, and magic attacks to battle a variety of fantastical creatures (e.g., giant bugs, robots, demons). Players select attacks/spells from a menu screen and watch characters employ the attacks in turn-based combat. Enemies usually blink and disappear when defeated. In one pre-battle cutscene, a character is depicted with small bloody cuts on her arms, legs, and torso. During the course of the game, a few sequences include drunken characters with flushed faces and slurred speech (e.g., “Ahhhh! Gerhard! Gimme another cup! I didn't know these tasted so good! I want, no, I need more!”). In one of these still-frame cutscenes, a drunken woman makes unwanted advances toward two other female characters (e.g., “Stop moving your hands all over me!” “The younger ones always feel so much more firm,” and “Bad girls like you need to be punished!”). Some female characters are also depicted in low-cut outfits that expose large amounts of cleavage; their breasts occasionally bounce while walking or jumping."", 'rating': 5}",1.333333333333333,NaN,60.0

The player's character can also engage in drinking games with other characters; the screen turns blurry after several drinks.

Lost Dimension,"{'synopsis': ""This is a role-playing game in which players assume the roles of young soldiers with psychic abilities as they battle evil forces intent on destroying the world. As they progress through the story, players engage in turn-based battles against robots, droids, and occasionally human enemies. Characters use pistols, machine guns, shotguns, swords, and psychic abilities (e.g., pyrokinesis, telekinesis) to deplete enemies' hit points. Robots and droids explode when defeated; human characters cry out in pain and collapse when defeated. Splashes of blood occasionally appear when sword-wielding characters flick their blades after a slashing attack. A handful of scenes contain suggestive dialogue: “I've no intention of accepting your friendliness tinged in sexual desire”; “[I] wouldn't know in terms of physical pleasure. I've never had sex before;” “[I]'m sure the chance to debut is higher with a cute face and big boobs.” The word “sh*t” appears in dialogue."", 'rating': 5}",1.333333333333333,NaN,62.0

Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain,"{'synopsis': 'This is a collection of action games in which players follow the story of characters from the Metal Gear Solid franchise. Players assume the role of elite soldiers through counter terrorist and military missions, using pistols, machine guns, and rocket launchers to kill various enemies (e.g., human soldiers, giant robots). Players can also employ close-up stealth attacks (e.g., choking and slitting throats from behind) to defeat enemies. Firefights are highlighted by screams of pain, realistic gunfire, and blood-splatter effects (blood also stains the ground). Some games allow non-adversary characters/prisoners to be injured or killed; cutscenes also depict intense acts of violence: enemy soldiers executed at point-blank range; a restrained character beaten during an interrogation. A comic-book-style sequence (hand-drawn still images) depicts a young character using a knife to execute captured soldiers. Some games in the collection include suggestive/sexual material: a man briefly groping a character\'s breasts; a male character\'s buttocks exposed as he runs through levels. In some sequences, players can enter a cardboard box (""Love Pack"") to engage in sexual acts with another character—there is no depiction of the sexual acts, though moaning sounds occur. Players also have the ability to unlock a “Snake Beater” award after repeatedly zooming in on a picture of a woman in lingerie. A handful of sequences include depictions of bathroom humor (e.g., a character defecating inside his pants; a character urinating off a platform onto another character). The game includes references to drugs in the dialogue (e.g., “The biggest cocaine consume in the world is the United States"" and ""How\'d he get the cocaine?""). The words “f**k” and “sh*t” can be heard in dialogue.', 'rating': 6}",2.666666666666667,NaN,71.3517190464177

Record of Agarest War,"{'synopsis': ""This is a fantasy role-playing game in which players control a hero and his troops through a span of five generations. Players explore towns, travel along map points, and fight humans and creatures in turn-based battle. Combat consists of small characters standing in place as players select weapons and attacks ('Trick Hit,' 'Earth Needle,' 'Magic Light Field,' etc.) from a menu screen; damage is indicated by various slashing sounds, light effects, and floating hit points rising above characters' heads. The game depicts several female characters whose breasts are partially obscured by towels, hot-spring mist, bed sheets, and revealing costumes. The dialogue contains numerous 'peeping' references, and brief innuendo about 'strange foreplay.' In one cutscene, female characters in a hot spring discuss relationships, boyfriends, and compare each others' bust sizes: 'I wonder if Leo prefers them large,' 'Yours will be just as large once you become an adult,' and 'Large is better than small in any event.' The game contains alcohol references (e.g., 'A toast! To ale and beds!' and 'Many years of drinking . . . taught her the secret to avoiding hangovers'), including a sequence in which a character slurs her speech, hiccups, then falls asleep on the tavern floor. Characters sometimes use language such as 'bastard' and 'damn' in the dialogue."", 'rating': 5}",1.333333333333333,NaN,81.7916072522157

The game contains some sexual material: players can visit a strip club depicting a topless pole dancer; players can visit a hotel where sexual moaning is heard—though no sex acts are depicted. The central character is persistently depicted smoking cigarettes, and some sequences allow players to control whether to share these cigarettes with others. Drugs are occasionally referenced in the dialogue (e.g., “She used mundy drugs” and “I hear they only go for the legs if they've used up the veins in their arms . . . or if they're trying to hide the marks.”); a corpse is depicted with needle track marks on its legs.

Remember Me,"{'synopsis': ""This is an action game in which players assume the role of a young woman named Nilin, a memory hunter in a futuristic setting. As players evade authorities and attempt to recover memory and identity, they battle various humans and robots. Players punch and kick enemies during melee combat and use a futuristic gun-like weapon called a “Spammer” against robots. Battles are accompanied by punching sounds, laser fire, slow-motion and screen-shaking effects. Some of the game's violence takes place during characters' memory “remixes,” which are presented as cutscenes that can be manipulated by changing certain elements. Memories include a chracter shooting a woman; a character shooting himself; a man removing a child's memories, which causes her to lose consciousness. Blood splatter effects and pools of blood sometimes appear in cutscenes; corpses are sometimes depicted in pools of blood during gameplay. Players occasionally come across posters depicting topless women or nude cabaret girls with partially exposed buttocks. Female leper-like figures are also occasionally shown topless. The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in the dialogue."", 'rating': 6}",,,

At the same time, most sword hits result in blue or red glowing flashes and enemies that tumble in the air and disappear. The game also features one-on-one combat with a black-cloaked Ring Wraith that shrieks loudly, and a few environments that are darker, more foreboding than the majority of the battles (which tend to be lighter, more colorful).', 'rating': 5}",,,

James Cameron's Avatar: The Game,"{'synopsis': 'Humans have found a precious metal that they want to extract from the fictional planet Pandora; indigenous alien warriors—blue-skinned ""Na\'vi""—have rallied against mining the planet, for they believe it will lead to destruction, death. Conflict ensues, as players choose to fight as either a human soldier or a Nav\'i warrior in this third-person action adventure game. In the role of an RDA Corporation soldier, players use machine guns, flamethrowers, ""shockwave"" bombs, and military vehicles to kill defending Na\'vi forces. This military-style combat represents the strongest violent content in the game: realistic artillery sounds, rapid-fire turrets (mounted on platforms), loud and bright explosions, muzzle-flash effects—these elements have the most impact. In the role of a Na\'vi warrior, players use dual-wielding axes, long staffs, and bow and arrows to kill invading RDA soldiers. This melee-style combat can be frenetic as well: players ""hack-and-slash"" enemy soldiers at a constant rate, causing them to get knocked back or disappear in a puff of blue mist. The mist effect is most prominent when native animals or the Na\'vi get hit—larger, fluid-like spurts are emitted; for example, in one cutscene, the blue hydraulic-like substance sputters out of a Na\'vi avatar struck down by an arrow (in slow motion). During the course of the game, characters sometimes use the expletives ""b*tch"" and ""bastard"" in dialogue; they also make a handful of jokes that are suggestive/sexual in nature (e.g., ""Like the clap. Officer Midori\'s waiting for you near the main gate"" and ""I was in Singapore with this fine ho*ker and . . . incredible . . . that\'s what she said."").

Players can also roam \'off-mission\' and kill non-adversaries (e.g., pedestrians, shop-keepers, homeless people, etc.) at any time. Collateral damage includes spurts of blood when characters are shot, stabbed, or bludgeoned and extensive post-mortem violence (e.g., players can keep shooting at dead bodies, causing them to flail and emit more blood; players can earn \'respect points\' for taunting dead human corpses). One cutscene depicts a character holding a decapitated head over a railing. The game features cutscenes and missions that contain depictions of sexual behavior: One cutscene depicts a woman\'s head moving out of screen and into a gang member\'s lap – suggesting fellatio; Intercourse is implied as players drive around a prostitute who ""performs"" with a client in the back seat. Certain missions involve drugs – delivering, selling or arranging transactions –, while players can also purchase marijuana blunts, which can impair the player\'s vision through a \'screen-blur\' effect.
